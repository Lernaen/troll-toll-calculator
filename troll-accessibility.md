# Troll Bridge Website Accessibility Guide

## Primary Web Accessibility Issues - An Overview

Trolls, being unique and diverse creatures, face various challenges when interacting with web content. Here's an overview of the primary accessibility issues for our troll users:

### Visual Impairments

- Many trolls, after long nights under bridges, struggle to see graphics due to visual impairments.
- Trolls with reduced contrast sensitivity, color perception, and near-focus problems often find it hard to read web pages, especially in bright daylight when they emerge from their dark dwellings.

### Hearing Impairments

- Older and battle-worn trolls might have difficulty hearing audio, particularly after years of roaring and bellowing.
- Differentiating higher-pitched sounds and separating background noise from important audio can be challenging, especially with the clamor of the troll community in the background.

### Internet Connection

- Many trolls use ancient and slow Internet connections, relying on outdated modems and primitive equipment that struggle to download large files.

### Assistive Technology

- Trolls often use assistive technology that mimics keyboard functions without needing a mouse, essential for those with large, clumsy hands or missing digits from skirmishes.

### Navigation Difficulties

Trolls may have trouble navigating poorly organized sites with unclear directions due to:
- Learning disabilities from troll childhoods spent under bridges.
- Speaking Trollish as a first language and picking up Human as a second language.
- Being younger or less experienced with modern technology, often preferring the simplicity of ancient troll runes.

### Physical Ability

- Reduced dexterity and fine motor control are common among trolls, making precise mouse movements and clicking small targets difficult.

### Cognitive Ability

- Trolls with reduced short-term memory, difficulty concentrating, and easy distractibility find it hard to follow complex navigation and complete online tasks, especially when theyâ€™re guarding their bridge from intruders.

## Troll Style Guidelines

### HTML

- Use correct semantic tags to make the HTML troll-friendly.
- Ensure a minimum of 100px spacing between elements to accommodate large troll fingers and avoid accidental clicks.

### Forms

- All input fields need clear, descriptive labels to allow for keyboard accessibility.
- Input field height should be 42px to suit big troll fingers.
- Descriptive placeholder text should guide trolls through the forms, using simple and direct language.

### Images

- All images should have descriptive `alt=""` tags to help visually impaired trolls understand the content.
- Images should be less than 2MB to ensure quick loading on slow troll Internet connections.

### Paragraph Text

- Minimum font-size: 1.25rem to ensure readability for trolls with poor vision.
- Minimum line-height: 1.5rem for clear, easy-to-read paragraphs.
- Letter-spacing: 2px to assist trolls with vision issues.
- Font type: Calibri for simplicity and clarity.
- Font color: #000000 for high contrast against backgrounds.

### Heading Text

#### H1

- Minimum font-size: 2.5rem to catch the attention of even the most distracted troll.
- Font type: Calibri.
- Font color: #000000 to stand out prominently.

#### H2

- Font color: #000000 for consistency and readability.

### Buttons

- Button width: 60px to accommodate troll paws.
- Button background color: #283629 (Dark Green from the header background), reminiscent of the moss and foliage around troll bridges.
- Button text color: #ffffff for clear readability, even for the oldest and most battle-weary trolls.

By following these guidelines, we ensure that all trolls, regardless of their unique challenges and abilities, can enjoy and navigate our website with ease.
